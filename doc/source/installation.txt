Installation:

This section explains how to build QCopter from the source, we provide
only tested linux distributions. However, by following the same steps,
QCopters can be installed easily on several different distro.

We start by installing depedencies:

On Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install gazebo gazebo-dev armadillo boost CMake python-numpy libmlpack-dev dronecodesdk


On fedora:



On arch:




Verify that gazebo is working by running gazebo in your terminal, if
everything is fine, you can start building QCopter from the source
code.

Build From the source code

After ensuring the installation of all dependecies, use git to
download the source code of QCopter.


git clone https://github.com/shrit/QCopters.git

cd QCopter

mkdir build && cd build

cmake ../

make -j4

When building is finished, we will notice a QCopter executable in the build folder.
