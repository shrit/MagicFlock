Thought and test to be questioned
=======================================



In the Q learning algorithm, or when generating th data set, The
leader execute a random action according to a random function. While
the followers execute another random actions.

The idea behind it to make the q learning algorithm find and learn the
best action to choose for the followers. This is done by making the algorithm
read the estimate the positionning error, and learn from the case where the error
is minimum.

During the trainning using the reinforcement learning, the algorithm
generate a data when executing the episods. Thus, we think about exploitation
this data set by applying Supervised learning.
