Need to install omnetpp from source (github)
Install Inet framework from the source too.

Comments from the maintainer about building the IDE of OMNET++

About building the ide: the code in the github repo is complete,
however the usual ./configure; make; command builds on the simulator.
The IDE code resides in the /ui directory. To build the whole
distribution, you should visit the /releng folder and execute the
distro build scripts there. Note that the build system uses docker, so
you should have docker daemon installed and running on Linux if you
want to uild the whole UI.




Actually we are using make build system:

To build the code using:

make -f makemakefiles





Questions about omnetpp here:

	  1. Verify the materials and their fading properties

	  2. Verify if simulation using open scen graph (OSG) uses the
	  propoer propagation models that suites the city for outdoors
	  and inside indoors.

	  3. Find a way to build the source code using cmake instead
	  of their build systems

	  4. Find a way to integrate the omnet code inside QCopter,
	    First start with two different build, and if every thing
	    is woring fine, integrate it inside QCopter	    	  

	  5. Find a way to repare open scene graph (Wait gitter
	  answer from the maintainer).
