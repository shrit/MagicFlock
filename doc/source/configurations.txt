Understanding the INI file:


This section helps the user to understand the configuration file of
QCopter. We use ini format as our standard config format. The
configuration file quad.ini is situated in the root directory.


You need to configure your QCopter before running it, The basic
configurations consist of different sections, each section has
different key=value pair.

The first sections [simulation] contain a general configurations about
QCopter, the sections named [quadcpters_x] contain the configurations
of each quadcopter, such as name model name and the port number to
enable communications with dronecode SDK.

QCopter use Gazebo publish subscribe system to communicate with Gazebo
and NS3 simulator. Publish-subscribe systems use topics to
communicates, where the publisher send the data on a specific topic,
and the receiver subscribe to this topic to recover the data. Since
topics have names, user should ensure that sender and receiver uses
the same name.

QCopter need to recover the position of each quadcopters. Therefore,
we connect QCopter to /gazebo/default/pose/info topic which contain
the position information for all the models in the environment.
