IL4MRC (Iterative Learning Models for Models Reactive Control), is a model
reactive control library that provide the users with a data driven approach to control a swarm
of quadrotors in Gazebo simulator. IL4MRC differ from other libraries by the
following:

* It has no dependencies on ROS
* Use a data driven approach
* Easy to install and to maintain (small amount of dependencies)

After installing IL4MRC, a set of examples can be compiled easily which can be found in `example\` folder.
Examples implement the algorithm needed to maintain a swarm of quadrotors from
taking off until landing. The objective is to maintain the swarm intact as
long as possible.

A generic example is provided as starter guide to understand the basic simulation principle.
All examples are documented on gitbook, can be found here.

### Documentation
